# Experiment 1: TRANSMISSION LINES
## Experimental Procedure:
*Note: Please record every measurement taken in the experiment and attach them in the results*
*section of the report*



1. Determine the operation frequency of the system by using Cavitywave meter:
	1. Check that the short load is connected
	2. Arrange the needle of the VSWR meter in a middle position
	3. Rotate the cavitymeter and record the frequency where a dramatic change in the
	needle position is observed.

2. Measuring guided wavelength:
	1. Off-tune the cavitywave meter
	2. Be sure the shorted load is connected
	3. Calibrate VSWR meter
		1. Find the voltage minimum point. (Point where the pointer stays most
		right position)
		2. Calibrate the voltage minimum to be on the value one by changing the
		gain nobes.
		3. Rotate the probe to take measurements from the second voltage
		minimum. Check that the pointer reads 1 (or close to 1) at the minimum
		voltage position for the second voltage.
	4. Find the voltage maximum (or voltage minimum) point and record its location
	from the ruler attached to the slotted line.
	5. Find the second voltage maximum (or minimum) point and record the location

3. Measuring VSWR values of the different loads :
	1. Record the value of the pointer when it is in the voltage maximum position (when
	the pointer is at the most left position)
	2. Repeat the same procedure for shorted, matched, open, and antenna loads.
	3. Each time the load is changed, the calibration procedure must be repeated.

4. Measuring the first voltage minimum position of sliding short load :
	1. Connect sliding short load. Pay attention to arranging the shorting pin at the
	same level as the waveguide aperture.
	2. Calibrate VSWR meter
	3. Find and record the position of the first voltage minimum position
	4. Rotate the screw on the shorted load ( you can decide the rotation amount)
		1. Record rotation distance
		2. Record the new position of the first voltage minimum position
	5. Repeat step d for 3 different screw positions
